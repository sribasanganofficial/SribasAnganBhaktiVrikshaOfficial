Elaborate Rasa-lila dramas are performed, depicting Krishna’s or divine pastimes, while the deities are dressed in exquisite attire. A vibrant prasadam feast follows, which nourishes both body and heart. As a hub of devotion in Kolkata, Sribas Angan brings together families in chanting, dancing, and prayer, fostering deep spiritual connection.
